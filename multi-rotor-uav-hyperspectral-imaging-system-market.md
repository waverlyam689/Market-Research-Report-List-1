<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multi-Rotor UAV Hyperspectral Imaging System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pushbroom Imaging</li><li>Frame-Based Imaging</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Multi-Rotor UAV Hyperspectral Imaging System market is primarily divided into two imaging types: Pushbroom Imaging and Frame-Based Imaging. Pushbroom Imaging utilizes a continuous sensor array that captures data across a swath as the UAV flies forward, resulting in high spatial and spectral resolution. In contrast, Frame-Based Imaging captures images in discrete frames, similar to traditional cameras, which can be easier to implement but may offer lower efficiency in data collection. Both methods serve various applications in agriculture, environmental monitoring, and mapping.</p></p>
